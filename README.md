# Unipilot Staking

This repository contains Unipilot staking smart contract.

## UnipilotStaking.sol
`UnipilotStaking.sol` allows unipilot holders to stake (`stake()`) unipilot tokens to receive rewards (reward token could be WETH or any other ERC-20 token). Staker can claim rewards (`claim()`). Stakers may unstake their unipilot tokens by calling `unstake()`, which will trigger the reward claim as well. For emergency unstake, stakers can call `emergencyUnstake()`, beaware that emergency unstake doesn't trigger reward claim and all your pending reward tokens are lost.
